# Course Background
ISYE6501 is a foundational course for Georgia Tech's OMSA and OMSCS.
# Key Takeaways
1. Learnt R: Was only passably aware of R before this. Would like to believe that I have obtained a much deeper understanding of R than I started out with. Definitely struggled on homework code at the start but office hours recordings and StackOverflow helped tremendously.
2. Gained a deeper understanding of the wide array of models that exist: Before this course, only really knew the standard machine learning models like linear and logistic regression, decision trees and XGBoost. Now that I've gone through the whole course I can safely say I was a small fish in a small pond and now I'm a small fish in an even bigger pond. This has definitely opened my eyes to many more different models and ways that these models can be used together to make a more robust analysis.
# Additional Thoughts
1. Seriously recommend tuning in to office hours and the statistics bootcamp put up by the TAs. These are all very relevant to the course and you will be much better off if you attend them.
2. Check Piazza often and participate in class discussions. Looking at the discussion questions posted every week is a good way to tickle your brain. Multiple times now I've found myself looking back at my notes to find the answer to one of these questions. I think they make you think a lot deeper into the course content and also about how it connects with other parts of the course as well.
